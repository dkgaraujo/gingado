    "* **support for model documentation**, to embed documentation and ethical considerations in the model development phase.\n",

    "Each of these functionalities builds on top of the previous one, and they can be used stand-alone, together, or even as part of a larger pipeline from data input to model training to documentation!"

    "* *offering compatibility with other existing software that is consolidated by wide practice* benefits users and should be promoted as much as possible"
