    "`gingado` seeks to facilitate the use of machine learning in economic and finance use cases, while promoting good practices. This package aims to be suitable for beginners and advanced users alike. Use cases may range from simple data retrievals to experimentation with machine learning algorithms to more complex model pipelines used in production."

    "`gingado` is a free, open source library built different functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **data augmentation**, to add more data from official sources, improving the machine models being trained by the user;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **automatic benchmark model**, to enable the user to assess their models against a reasonably well-performant model; \n",
    "\n",
    "* *(new!)* **relevant datasets**, both real and simulamed, to allow for easier model development and comparison;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **support for model documentation**, to embed documentation and ethical considerations in the model development phase; and\n",
    "\n",
    "* **utils**, including tools to allow for lagging variables in a straightforward way.\n",
    "\n",

    "* **flexibility**: users can use `gingado` out of the box or build custom processes on top of it;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **compatibility**: `gingado` works well with other widely used libraries in machine learning, such as `scikit-learn` and `pandas`; and\n",
