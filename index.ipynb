In addition to more general benefits, `gingado` is designed to align well with the workflow needs of economists due to its support for panel datasets and the functionality to quickly and easily add official statistical data on macroeconomics and finance to the user dataset."

    "`gingado` is built around three main functionalities:\n",
    "* **data augmentation**, to add more data from official sources, improving the machine models being trained by the user;\n",
    "* **automatic benchmark model**, to enable the user to assess their models against a reasonably well-performant model; and\n",
    "* **support for model documentation**, to embed documentation and ethical considerations in the model development phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functionalities is illustrated below for a user trying to forecast GDP growth. Each step builds on top of the previous one, and they can be used stand-alone, together, or even as part of a larger pipeline from data input to model training to documentation! But to highlight how `gingado` can benefit users in multiple ways, the brief walk-through below goes over them separtely and then highlights how they can work jointly. \n",

For example, for the same time periods we can add detailed information on trade, inflation, labour markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and many other series that would help machine learning models better form predictions. \n",

    "In particular, `gingado`'s function `augm_with_sdmx` looks for all data available from the desired sources for the defined period and frequency and downloads them all, but only adds to the original dataset the variables that bring some level of variance in the data that can be explored by the machine learning models later on."
