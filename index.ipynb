    "\n",
    "`gingado` is a free, open source library built around three main functionalities:\n",
    "* **data augmentation**, to add more data from official sources, improving the machine models being trained by the user;\n",
    "* **automatic benchmark model**, to enable the user to assess their models against a reasonably well-performant model; and\n",
    "* **support for model documentation**, to embed documentation and ethical considerations in the model development phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functionalities builds on top of the previous one. They can be used on a stand-alone basis, together, or even as part of a larger pipeline from data input to model training to documentation!"

    "\n",
    "The choices made during development of `gingado` derive from the following principles, in no particular order:\n",
    "* **flexibility**: users can use `gingado` out of the box or build custom processes on top of it\n",
    "* **compatibility**: `gingado` works well with other widely used libraries in machine learning, such as `scikit-learn` and `pandas`\n",
    "* **responsibility**: `gingado` facilitates and promotes model documentation, including ethical considerations, as part of the machine learning development workflow"
