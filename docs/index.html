<p><code>gingado</code> seeks to facilitate the use of machine learning in economic and finance use cases, while promoting good practices. <code>gingado</code> aims to be suitable for beginners and advanced users alike.</p>

<h2 id="Overview">Overview<a class="anchor-link" href="#Overview"> </a></h2><p><code>gingado</code> is a free, open source library built around three main functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>data augmentation</strong>, to add more data from official sources, improving the machine models being trained by the user;</li>
<li><strong>automatic benchmark model</strong>, to enable the user to assess their models against a reasonably well-performant model; and</li>
<li><strong>support for model documentation</strong>, to embed documentation and ethical considerations in the model development phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these functionalities builds on top of the previous one. They can be used on a stand-alone basis, together, or even as part of a larger pipeline from data input to model training to documentation!</p>

<h2 id="Design-principles">Design principles<a class="anchor-link" href="#Design-principles"> </a></h2><p>The choices made during development of <code>gingado</code> derive from the following principles, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>lowering the barrier to use machine learning</em> can help more economists familiarise themselves with these techniques and use them when appopriate</li>
<li><em>offering compatibility with other existing software that is consolidated by wide practice</em> benefits users and should be promoted as much as possible</li>
<li><em>promoting good practices</em> such as documenting ethical considerations and benchmarking models as part of machine learning development will help embed these habits in economists</li>
</ul>
