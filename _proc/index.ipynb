    "`gingado` is a free, open source library built different functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**data augmentation**](augmentation.html), to add more data from official sources, improving the machine models being trained by the user;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **automatic** [**benchmark model**](benchmark.html), to assess candidate models against a reasonably well-performant model; \n",
    "\n",
    "* *(new!)* **relevant** [**datasets**](datasets.html), both real and simulamed, to allow for easier model development and comparison;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **support for** [**model documentation**](documentation.html), to embed documentation and ethical considerations in the model development phase; and\n",

    "* **flexibility**: users can use `gingado` out of the box or build custom processes on top of it;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **compatibility**: `gingado` works well with other widely used libraries in machine learning, such as `scikit-learn` and `pandas`; and\n",
