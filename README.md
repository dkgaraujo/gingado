Welcome to gingado!

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

`gingado` seeks to facilitate the use of machine learning in economic
and finance use cases, while promoting good practices. This package aims
to be suitable for beginners and advanced users alike. Use cases may
range from simple data retrievals to experimentation with machine
learning algorithms to more complex model pipelines used in production.

## Overview

`gingado` is a free, open source library built different
functionalities:

- **data augmentation**, to add more data from official sources,
  improving the machine models being trained by the user;

- **automatic benchmark model**, to enable the user to assess their
  models against a reasonably well-performant model;

- *(new!)* **relevant datasets**, both real and simulamed, to allow for
  easier model development and comparison;

- **support for model documentation**, to embed documentation and
  ethical considerations in the model development phase; and

- **utils**, including tools to allow for lagging variables in a
  straightforward way.

Each of these functionalities builds on top of the previous one. They
can be used on a stand-alone basis, together, or even as part of a
larger pipeline from data input to model training to documentation!

## Design principles

The choices made during development of `gingado` derive from the
following principles, in no particular order:

- **flexibility**: users can use `gingado` out of the box or build
  custom processes on top of it;

- **compatibility**: `gingado` works well with other widely used
  libraries in machine learning, such as `scikit-learn` and `pandas`;
  and

- **responsibility**: `gingado` facilitates and promotes model
  documentation, including ethical considerations, as part of the
  machine learning development workflow.

## Acknowledgements

`gingado`’s API is inspired on the following libraries:

- `scikit-learn` ([API description](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0238))

- `keras` (website [here](https://keras.io/about/) and also, [this
  essay](https://medium.com/s/story/notes-to-myself-on-software-engineering-c890f16f4e4d))

- `fastai` ([description here](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/2/108))

In addition, `gingado` is developed and maintained using
[`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai).
